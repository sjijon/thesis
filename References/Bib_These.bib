@article{Bonneton2020,
	abstract = {Objectives: We aimed to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe measles based on the number of vaccine doses administered and the time since last vaccination. Patients and methods: We included measles cases aged at least 2 years and born since 1980 who were notified in France between 2006 and mid-2019. We considered two severity levels (moderate, severe) and calculated adjusted relative risks (aRR) using multinomial logistic regression. Results: We included 10,399 cases. The risk of severe measles in two-dose vaccine recipients was 71{\%} (aRR = 0.29 [95{\%}CI 0.12--0.72]) and 83{\%} (aRR = 0.17 [95{\%}CI 0.04--0.70]) lower than in unvaccinated cases, if the time since last dose was less or more than 15 years, respectively. The risk of moderate disease followed a similar pattern. Conclusions: Two-dose measles vaccination provided long-term protection against severe cases, even after vaccine failures. These findings underscore the need for compliance to the recommended measles vaccination schedule to prevent severe cases.},

The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between COVID-19 county death rates, risk perception, and U.S. adults' voluntary behaviors---particularly physical distancing. Data were collected from CloudResearch/Qualtrics, Johns Hopkins University, the American Community Survey, and SafeGraph. Our results indicated that higher COVID-19 county death rates were associated with higher risk perceptions, leading to greater time spent at home. These findings will help public health officials identify strategies that best encourage voluntary health behaviors to help curb the spread of COVID-19.},

@article{Abrams2020,
	abstract = {During the unprecedented times caused by the novel coronavirus disease 2019, there is rapidly evolving information and guidance. However, a focus must also be on proper and effective risk communication. This is especially the case during pandemics that have high rates of infection, significant morbidity, lack of therapeutic measures, and rapid increases in cases, all of which apply to the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. A consequence of poor risk communication and heightened risk perception is hoarding behavior, which can lead to lack of medications and personal protective equipment. One potential way to ensure appropriate risk communication is using social media channels, and ensuring an ongoing consistent media presence. Another important step is to include all stakeholders including members of the allergy community in broader public health messaging. As we continue to face unprecedented times in the allergy community, an understanding and appreciation of risk communication will be essential as we communicate with, and inform, our patients, and our colleagues, moving forward.},

@article{Gomez2020,
	abstract = {Despite PrEP's effectiveness as an HIV prevention intervention, uptake among gay and bisexual men remains low. Historical involvement in AIDS activism may reveal important ways of mobilising gay and bisexual men to increase PrEP uptake. Data come from a qualitative study to understand New York City gay and bisexual men's experiences with PrEP. Informed by a constructivist grounded theory approach, we assessed ways in which gay and bisexual men's relational experiences concerning PrEP were congruent with features of past AIDS activism. Participants' mean age was 32.5 years, half were men of colour, and over half had been taking PrEP for less than one year. Analysis revealed three primary themes related to AIDS activism strategies: (1) framing, which referenced how participants referred to PrEP as an empowering, liberatory and community-building intervention (2) reactions, which encompassed positive to negative expressions about PrEP and sex; and (3) innovation, which conveyed ways that participants engaged in processes of transferring lay knowledge about PrEP through leadership roles across social and digital encounters. Findings suggest that the ways in which gay and bisexual men communicate about PrEP with peers are consistent with features of AIDS activism. Deploying lay knowledge using framing strategies through peer-based intervention could expand PrEP uptake. However, elements of PrEP stigma must be addressed to engage with the wide-ranging HIV prevention needs of gay and bisexual men.},

@article{Graham2019,
	abstract = {All World Health Organization regions have set measles elimination goals. We find that as countries progress toward these goals, they undergo predictable changes in the size and frequency of measles outbreaks. A country's position on this ``canonical path'' is driven by both measles control activities and demographic factors, which combine to change the effective size of the measles-susceptible population, thereby driving the country through theoretically established dynamic regimes. Further, position on the path to elimination provides critical information for guiding vaccination efforts, such as the age profile of susceptibility, that could only otherwise be obtained through costly field studies or sophisticated analysis. Equipped with this information, countries can gain insight into their current and future measles epidemiology and select appropriate strategies to more quickly achieve elimination goals.},

	abstract = {Background Health care for people living with HIV has improved substantially in the past two decades. Robust estimates of how these improvements have affected prognosis and life expectancy are of utmost importance to patients, clinicians, and health-care planners. We examined changes in 3 year survival and life expectancy of patients starting combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 1996 and 2013. Methods We analysed data from 18 European and North American HIV-1 cohorts. Patients (aged ≥16 years) were eligible for this analysis if they had started ART with three or more drugs between 1996 and 2010 and had at least 3 years of potential follow-up. We estimated adjusted (for age, sex, AIDS, risk group, CD4 cell count, and HIV-1 RNA at start of ART) all-cause and cause-specific mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for the first year after ART initiation and the second and third years after ART initiation in four calendar periods (1996--99, 2000--03 [comparator], 2004--07, 2008--10). We estimated life expectancy by calendar period of initiation of ART. Findings 88 504 patients were included in our analyses, of whom 2106 died during the first year of ART and 2302 died during the second or third year of ART. Patients starting ART in 2008--10 had lower all-cause mortality in the first year after ART initiation than did patients starting ART in 2000--03 (adjusted HR 0{\textperiodcentered}71, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}61--0{\textperiodcentered}83). All-cause mortality in the second and third years after initiation of ART was also lower in patients who started ART in 2008--10 than in those who started in 2000--03 (0{\textperiodcentered}57, 0{\textperiodcentered}49--0{\textperiodcentered}67); this decrease was not fully explained by viral load and CD4 cell count at 1 year. Rates of non-AIDS deaths were lower in patients who started ART in 2008--10 (vs 2000--03) in the first year (0{\textperiodcentered}48, 0{\textperiodcentered}34--0{\textperiodcentered}67) and second and third years (0{\textperiodcentered}29, 0{\textperiodcentered}21--0{\textperiodcentered}40) after initiation of ART. Between 1996 and 2010, life expectancy in 20-year-old patients starting ART increased by about 9 years in women and 10 years in men. Interpretation Even in the late ART era, survival during the first 3 years of ART continues to improve, which probably reflects transition to less toxic antiretroviral drugs, improved adherence, prophylactic measures, and management of comorbidity. Prognostic models and life expectancy estimates should be updated to account for these improvements.

@article{Gallo2013,
	abstract = {Changes in fertility (delivery success), fecundity (litter size and weaning success), sensitivity to pregnancy-blocking stimuli (mate removal after 24 h), and hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function were assessed during reproductive aging in the Djungarian hamster, Phodopus campbelli. All indices of aging occurred earlier in the Djungarian hamster than they do in other laboratory models, including the mouse. Fertility and fecundity were halved by 8 mo of age, and the response to pregnancy-blocking stimuli disappeared by 4-6 mo. Pup birth weight increased with maternal age and decreasing litter size. Older females also tended to lose entire litters rather than to reduce litter size and successfully wean remaining pups. Impaired ovarian function was a major contributor to reproductive aging. Numbers of large antral follicles developing in aged females and in aged females receiving eCG treatment were similar to those in young females. However, a few preovulatory follicles routinely failed to ovulate from each ovary. Healthy preovulatory follicles in old females secreted the large quantities of estradiol-17 beta typical of estrous cycles, but eCG-induced preovulatory follicles did not. As young females of this species have smaller folicular reserves than other rodent species, and follicle numbers in older females are further reduced (with a high incidence of completely degenerate ovaries), follicular exhaustion was coincident with reproductive failure. Neuroendocrine aging of the hypothalamus was also implicated in the loss of a pregnancy-blocking response and the failure of maternal care with increasing maternal age. Similarities to reproductive aging in long-cycle species (including primates) suggest that the Djungarian hamster is a useful laboratory model that deserves further investigation},

@article{Granich2009,
	abstract = {Background: Roughly 3 million people worldwide were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the end of 2007, but an estimated 6??7 million were still in need of treatment and a further 2??7 million became infected with HIV in 2007. Prevention efforts might reduce HIV incidence but are unlikely to eliminate this disease. We investigated a theoretical strategy of universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate treatment with ART, and examined the conditions under which the HIV epidemic could be driven towards elimination. Methods: We used mathematical models to explore the effect on the case reproduction number (stochastic model) and long-term dynamics of the HIV epidemic (deterministic transmission model) of testing all people in our test-case community (aged 15 years and older) for HIV every year and starting people on ART immediately after they are diagnosed HIV positive. We used data from South Africa as the test case for a generalised epidemic, and assumed that all HIV transmission was heterosexual. Findings: The studied strategy could greatly accelerate the transition from the present endemic phase, in which most adults living with HIV are not receiving ART, to an elimination phase, in which most are on ART, within 5 years. It could reduce HIV incidence and mortality to less than one case per 1000 people per year by 2016, or within 10 years of full implementation of the strategy, and reduce the prevalence of HIV to less than 1{\%} within 50 years. We estimate that in 2032, the yearly cost of the present strategy and the theoretical strategy would both be US{\$}1??7 billion; however, after this time, the cost of the present strategy would continue to increase whereas that of the theoretical strategy would decrease. Interpretation: Universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate ART, combined with present prevention approaches, could have a major effect on severe generalised HIV/AIDS epidemics. This approach merits further mathematical modelling, research, and broad consultation. Funding: None. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Eichner1996,
	abstract = {Most polio virus infections are silent. Vaccination reduces the incidence of infection, and the period between clinical cases of poliomyelitis becomes longer. As the point of eradication is approached, it becomes increasingly difficult to use the case-free period to determine whether silent infections have ceased. In this paper, the authors use stochastic computer simulations to relate case-free periods to the presence or absence of silent infections. After 2 years without paralytic cases in a population of 200,000 inhabitants, the probability for the presence of silent infections can still be as high as 38{\%}. The case-free period must exceed 3 years before one can be 95{\%} certain that there has been local extinction of the wild polio virus infection. Even after 5 years without cases, the probability of silent polio virus transmission can still be in the range of 0.1-1.0{\%}.},

	abstract = {Deciding the end of an epidemic is frequently associated with forthcoming changes in infectious disease control activities, including downgrading alert level in surveillance and restoring healthcare workers' working shift back to normal. Despite the practical importance, there have been little epidemiological and laboratory methods that were proposed to determine the end of an epidemic. This short review was aimed to systematically discuss methodological principles of a small number of existing techniques and understand their advantages and disadvantages. Existing epidemiological methods have been mostly limited to a single-and-brief exposure setting, while the application to human-to-human transmissible disease epidemic with stochastic dependence structure in the observed case data has remained to be a statistical challenge. In veterinary applications, a large-scale sampling for laboratory testing has been commonly adapted to substantiate a freedom from disease, but such study has only accounted for binomial sampling process in estimating the error probability of elimination. Surveillance and mathematical modeling are two complementary instruments in the toolbox of epidemiologists. Combining their strengths would be highly beneficial to better define the end of an epidemic.},

Rational exemption implies that families will tend to relate the decision to vaccinate their children to the available information on the state of the disease. Using an SIR model with information dependent vaccination we show that rational exemption might make elimination of the disease an unfeasible task even if coverages as high as 100{\%} are actually reached during epochs of high social alarm. Moreover, we show that rational exemption may also become responsible for the onset of sustained oscillations when the decision to vaccinate also depends on the past history of the disease. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Keenan2017,
	abstract = {Objectives: There was a large outbreak of measles in Liverpool, UK, in 2012 2013, despite measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisation uptake rates that were higher than the national average. We estimated measles susceptibility of a cohort of children born in Liverpool between 1995 and 2012 to understand whether there was a change in susceptibility before and after the outbreak and to inform vaccination strategy. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: The city of Liverpool, North West UK. Participants: All children born in Liverpool (72 101) between 1995 and 2012 inclusive who were identified using the Child Health Information System (CHIS) and were still resident within Liverpool in 2014. Primary and secondary outcome measures: We estimated cohort age-disaggregated and neighbourhood-disaggregated measles susceptibility according to WHO thresholds before and after the outbreak for children aged 1 17 years. Results: Susceptibility to measles was above WHO elimination thresholds before and after the measles outbreak in the 10+ age group. The proportion of children susceptible before and after outbreak, respectively: age 14 years 15.0{\%} before and 14.9{\%} after; age 59 years 9.9{\%} before and 7.7{\%} after; age 10+ years 8.6{\%} before and 8.5{\%} after. Despite an intensive MMR immunisation catch-up campaign after the 2012 2013 measles outbreak, the overall proportion of children with no MMR remains high at 6.1{\%} (4390/72 351). Across all age groups and before and after the outbreak, measles susceptibility was clustered by neighbourhood, with deprived areas having the greatest proportion of susceptible children. Conclusions: The risk of sustained measles outbreaks remains, especially as large pools of susceptible older children will start leaving secondary education and continue to aggregate in higher education, employment and other community settings and institutions resulting in the potential for a propagated measles outbreak.},

@article{Edmund2000,
	abstract = {SUMMARY Data on the pre-vaccination patterns of infection for measles, mumps and rubella are collated from a number of European countries in order to compare the epidemiology of the three viruses. Key epidemiological parameters, such as the age-specific force of infection and the basic reproduction number (R !) are estimated from case notification or serological data using standard techniques. A method is described to compare force of infection estimates derived from serological data. Analysis suggests that the pre-vaccination patterns of measles and mumps infection in the different countries were similar. In contrast, the epidemiology of rubella was highly variable between countries. This suggests that it may be acceptable to use parameter values estimated from other countries to model measles and mumps transmission, but that this approach to modelling rubella transmission requires more caution. Estimates of R ! depend on underlying mixing assumptions. Constraints were placed on R ! estimates by utilising knowledge of likely mixing patterns. The estimates for R ! were highest for measles, intermediate for mumps, and generally lowest for rubella. Analysis of within-and between-age-group transmission rates suggested that mumps transmission tends to be more concentrated within young children than the other two viruses. The implications for the design of immunization programmes are that mumps may be the easiest to control via infant immunization since it is predominantly transmitted between the very young and the variability in rubella epidemiology requires that careful consideration of the possible effects of vaccination options should be made using local data when planning rubella immunization programmes.},

The disease was described by the Persian physician Rhazes in the 10th century as ``more to be dreaded than smallpox.'' In 1846, Peter Panum described the incubation period of measles and lifelong immunity after recovery from the disease. Enders and Peebles isolated the virus in human and monkey kidney tissue culture in 1954. The first live attenuated vaccine was licensed for use in the United States in 1963 (Edmonston B strain). Before a vaccine was available, infection with measles virus was nearly universal during childhood, and more than 90{\%} of persons were immune by age 15 years. Measles is still a common and often fatal disease in developing countries. The World Health Organization estimates there were 145,700 deaths globally from measles in 2013.},

@article{HodgesMameletzis2018,
	abstract = {In September 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched evidence-based guidelines by recommending that any person at substantial HIV risk should be offered oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as an additional prevention choice. Since 2017, PrEP medicines have also been listed in the WHO's Essential Medicines List, including TDF/emtricitabine (FTC) and TDF in combination with lamivudine (3TC). A descriptive policy review and analysis of countries adopting WHO's 2015 recommendation on oral PrEP was conducted. As of June 2018, we identified 35 countries that had some type of policy on oral PrEP, and an additional five countries where a specific policy on PrEP is currently pending. A total of 19 high-income countries (HICs) and 21 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have adopted or have a pending policy. Most countries that have adopted or pending PrEP are in the European (42.9{\%}) or African (30.0{\%}) region. TDF/FTC is the most commonly recommended PrEP drug in the guidelines reviewed, although seven countries, namely in sub-Saharan Africa (6/7), are also recommending the use of TDF/3TC for PrEP. In sum, by the end of 2018, at least 40 countries (20.6{\%}) are anticipated to have adopted WHO's oral PrEP recommendation. Nonetheless, policy uptake does not reflect broader programmatic coverage of PrEP services, which remain limited across all settings, irrespective of income status. Enhancing global partnerships is needed to support and track ongoing policy adoption and to ensure that policy is translated into meaningful implementation of PrEP services.},

This study systematically reviews the acceptability of PrEP among men who have sex with men (MSM) worldwide. We searched major English databases to identify English-language articles published between July 2007 and July 2016, which reported the acceptability of PrEP and associated population characteristics. Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate a pooled acceptability, and meta-regression and subgroup analysis were used to analyse heterogeneities. The estimated acceptance from included sixty-eight articles was 57.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence internal 52.4--63.1{\%}). MSM who were younger (4/5 studies, range of adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.39--3.47), better educated (aOR = 1.49--7.70), wealthier (aOR = 1.31--13.03) and previously aware of PrEP (aOR = 1.33--3.30) showed significantly higher acceptance. Male sex workers (84.0{\%} [26.3--98.7{\%}] were more likely to accept PrEP than general MSM. Self-perceived low efficacy, concern about side effects, adherence, affordability, and stigma were main barriers. This review identifies a moderate acceptability of PrEP in MSM. Efficacy, perception of HIV risk and experienced stigma determine its acceptance.},

@article{LeVasseur2018,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective tool in preventing HIV infection among high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM). It is unknown how effective PrEP is in the context of other implemented HIV prevention strategies, including condom use, seroadaption, and treatment as prevention (TasP). We evaluate the impact of increasing uptake of PrEP in conjunction with established prevention strategies on HIV incidence in a high-risk population of MSM through simulation. METHODS Agent-based simulation models representing the sexual behavior of high-risk, urban MSM in the United States over the period of 1 year were used to evaluate the effect of PrEP on HIV infection rates. Simulations included data for 10,000 MSM and compared increasing rates of PrEP uptake under 8 prevention paradigms: no additional strategies, TasP, condom use, seroadaptive behavior, and combinations thereof. RESULTS We observed a mean of 103.2 infections per 10,000 MSM in the absence of any prevention method. PrEP uptake at 25{\%} without any additional prevention strategies prevented 30.7{\%} of infections. In the absence of PrEP, TasP, condom use, and seroadaptive behavior independently prevented 27.1{\%}, 48.8{\%}, and 37.7{\%} of infections, respectively, and together prevented 72.2{\%}. The addition of PrEP to the 3 aforementioned prevention methods, at 25{\%} uptake, prevented an additional 5.0{\%} of infections. CONCLUSIONS To achieve a 25{\%} reduction in HIV infections by 2020, HIV prevention efforts should focus on significantly scaling up access to PrEP in addition to HIV testing, access to antiretroviral therapy, and promoting condom use.},

@article{Jijon2017,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017. We model outcomes of voluntary prevention using an imperfect vaccine, which confers protection only to a fraction of vaccinees for a limited duration. Our mathematical model combines a single-player game for the individual-level decision to get vaccinated, and a compartmental model for the epidemic dynamics. Mathematical analysis yields a characterization for the effective vaccination coverage, as a function of the relative cost of prevention versus treatment; note that cost may involve monetary as well as non-monetary aspects. Three behaviors are possible. First, the relative cost may be too high, so individuals do not get vaccinated. Second, the relative cost may be moderate, such that some individuals get vaccinated and voluntary vaccination alleviates the epidemic. In this case, the vaccination coverage grows steadily with decreasing relative cost of vaccination versus treatment. Unlike previous studies, we find a third case where relative cost is sufficiently low so epidemics may be averted through the use of prevention, even for an imperfect vaccine. However, we also found that disease elimination is only temporary-as no equilibrium exists for the individual strategy in this third case-and, with increasing perceived cost of vaccination versus treatment, the situation may be reversed toward the epidemic edge, where the effective reproductive number is 1. Thus, maintaining relative cost sufficiently low will be the main challenge to maintain disease elimination. Furthermore, our model offers insight on vaccine parameters, which are otherwise difficult to estimate. We apply our findings to the epidemiology of measles.},
